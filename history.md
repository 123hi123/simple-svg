# Project History

## 2023-07-05

- Modified `start_server.bat` to run the server more effectively in the background
  - Updated the command to use `start "" /b cmd /c node server.js`
  - This change ensures that the command prompt window closes immediately after starting the server
  - The server now runs more seamlessly in the background

## 2023-07-05 (Update)

- Further improved `start_server.bat` based on user feedback:
  - Added `taskkill` command to close any existing node.exe processes on port 1024 before starting a new one
  - Updated the `start` command to use both `/b` and `/min` flags: `start "" /b /min cmd /c node server.js`
  - These changes ensure that:
    1. Only one instance of the server is running at a time
    2. The server runs in the background without showing a CMD window
  - The bat file now provides a more seamless experience when starting the server

## 2023-07-05 (Update 2)

- Implemented a VBS solution to effectively hide the CMD window when starting the server:
  - Created a new file `start_server_hidden.vbs` that runs the batch file in a hidden window
  - Updated `start_server.bat` to focus solely on server operations:
    - Removed the part about running in the background (now handled by the VBS file)
    - Maintained the functionality to close existing processes and start the server
  - To start the server without showing a CMD window, users should now run `start_server_hidden.vbs`
  - This change provides a truly hidden server startup process while maintaining all previous functionality

## 2023-07-06

- Implemented icon generation service:
  - Created `iconService.js` to handle icon generation logic
  - Updated `server.js` to include a new route for icon requests
  - Modified `index.html` to add icon generation functionality:
    - Added a form for users to input icon parameters (text, size, color, background color)
    - Implemented JavaScript function to send AJAX requests to the icon service
    - Updated the page to display generated icons in the render area
  - These changes allow users to generate custom icons directly from the web interface

## 2023-07-07

- Added favicon to the web application:
  - Created a new file `favicon.svg` with a simple SVG icon
  - Updated `index.html` to include a link to the favicon in the `<head>` section
  - This change adds a custom icon to the browser tab, improving the visual identity of the application
